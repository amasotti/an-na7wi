An-Nahwi (Ø§Ù„Ù†Ø­ÙˆÙŠ - "The Grammarian") is a learning project I started because I couldn't find a good Arabic learning app
that combined text management, roots in-depth study, vocabulary learning and some analytics and flashcards learning
tools.

**What it does**: Manage Arabic texts, explore word roots, build vocabulary, and track learning progress. Nothing
revolutionary, just tools that I needed and thought others might find useful too.

**Stack**: Kotlin/Quarkus backend, Nuxt 4/TypeScript frontend, PostgreSQL database

**Reality check**: This is a personal project, not a polished product. The database starts mostly empty - you'll need to
add your own texts and vocabulary as you learn. There are scripts included to backup, restore, and populate the database
with some sample data, syncing them to a S3 bucket. 
Some features are incomplete, bugs are not excluded. But the core functionality works, and if you're learning Arabic 
and like to tinker with code, you might find it helpful.

## What you need to run it

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (easiest way to get started)
- **Java 21+** (if you want to hack on the backend)
- **Node.js 22+** and **pnpm** (for frontend development)
- **PostgreSQL 17+** (if you prefer running locally)

### Build Tools

- Backend uses Gradle wrapper for Quarkus/Kotlin builds
- Frontend uses pnpm for Node.js dependencies and Nuxt development

## What's in here

The app has these main parts:

- **Text management**: Add Arabic texts, mark difficult words, take notes
- **Root exploration**: Browse Arabic roots and see related vocabulary
- **Vocabulary building**: Track words you're learning with translations and examples
- **Flashcard system**: Basic spaced repetition for vocabulary practice
- **Simple analytics**: See what you've been working on
